Trees:
Types:
- Binary tree - a tree with only 2 possible nodes. Nodes are added to the tree in breadth first fashion from left to right in each row
- Binary Search Tree - a binary tree where left node is <= parent, and right node is > parent


      1
      /\
    2   3
  /\
 4 5

Depth First Traversals:
(a) Inorder (Left, Root, Right) : 4 2 5 1 3
(b) Preorder (Root, Left, Right) : 1 2 4 5 3
(c) Postorder (Left, Right, Root) : 4 5 2 3 1

Breadth First or Level Order Traversal : 1 2 3 4 5
- implemented typically recursively since # of rows is unknown in a tree
- Traverses left to right on each row since it adds nodes to the queue left to right
- Time complexity O(n^2) where n is row number, row = 0 is the root node.
- Callstack has each recursive call made for each row of the tree. So for n rows = n calls on the callstack.
- Represented by a queue of all the nodes in each row, and each call is an evaluation of all the nodes in the queue for a given row.

binary search tree:

Inorder on binary search tree = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8  (left, root, right)
  - Inorder will return an array of values sorted in ascending order for a BST

Preorder on binary search tree = 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 7, 6, 8 (root, left, right)
  - Preorder is used to create an array of values that if started from the front of the array to form a BST, you'd get the
  same result (ex. 5 then 4, then 3...to create the BST);
  - Preorder is used if you want to search all of the roots before diving into its leaves

Postorder on binary search tree = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 7, 5 (left, right, root)
  - Use Postorder if you want to search all the leaves of any tree before searching the roots
  - Use it also to delete nodes from a tree since you delete the leaves before their parent
